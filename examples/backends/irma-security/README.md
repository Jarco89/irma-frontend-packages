# Nodejs security example

This package is an example for how to use the `irma-security` plugin. The demo
is supposed to be run with `nodejs` in the terminal. See the source of
`index.js` for how we use the plugin.

The demo shows how you can use a security token in the headers of your request
to the IRMA server, or sign the payload with your private key.

You can run this example by running these commands in this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
